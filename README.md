## Description
This project combines Java and XML database technologies to show:
- The creation and manipulation of XML documents using the DOM API.
- Querying XML data stored in an [eXist-db](https://exist-db.org/) database with XQuery.

The purpose is to provide a foundational understanding of working with XML databases in applications.

## Features
- Create XML documents dynamically using Java's DOM API.
- Interact with an eXist-db database for storing and retrieving XML data.
- Execute XQuery scripts to query and manipulate XML data.
- Simple and reusable code structure for learning and extending.

## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 8 or higher.
- **eXist-db** installed and running locally or on a server.
- Any modern IDE with Java support (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans).
- Basic knowledge of XML, XQuery, and Java programming.
